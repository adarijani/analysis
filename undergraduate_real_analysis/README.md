Reading a couple of books to reach [Mathematical Maturity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_maturity) in [Undergraduate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undergraduate_education) [Real Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_analysis).

First Step:
* [Terence Tao](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~tao/)'s Books:
  - [Analysis  I](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-19-7261-4) by [Terence Tao](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~tao/)
  - [Analysis II](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-19-7284-3) by [Terence Tao](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~tao/)

Second Step:
* [Baby Rudin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principles_of_Mathematical_Analysis):
  - [Principles of Mathematical Analysis](https://www.mheducation.com/highered/product/principles-mathematical-analysis-rudin/M9780070542358.html) by [Walter Rudin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Rudin)
