To my understanding [Terence Tao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Tao) used to use [Baby Rudin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principles_of_Mathematical_Analysis) for his Math131AH and Math131BH which are Honors Analysis in the American sense at [UCLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles).

In his words: 

> Textbook: Principles of Mathematical Analysis, Walter Rudin, Third edition, International Series in Pure and Applied Mathematics, McGraw-Hill Inc. 1976.   The topics to be covered can be found at the course page.  We will use both the textbook and my own lecture notes; it is strongly recommended that you read both concurrently with the course (and not just when it is time to do homework!).  The book may be a challenge to read at first - it is written in a professional, no-nonsense style, designed to convey information as succinctly and precisely as possible - however if you make a serious effort to go through all the theorems, proofs, definitions and remarks, and understand them as much as possible, then you will get a lot more out of this course (And you will be better prepared to handle other math classes in the future).  Note also that while you will be examined on the material in the notes, we may not cover all of the notes during the class.  Thus I do expect you to supplement your attendance at lectures with the reading of the notes.

Long story short those lecture notes got polished and became a text on their own.

My goal is to start learning analysis on my own starting from Tao's books and probably move on to [Baby Rudin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principles_of_Mathematical_Analysis). Here are my non-copyrighted stuff that helped me go through them.
